  the objective function?

  For example, for the investment design problem, one might write:
  ``Let variable~$m_{ij}$ take value~$1$ if basket~$i$ invests in
  credit~$j$, and value~$0$ otherwise, with $i \in 1 \twodots v$ and
  $j \in 1 \twodots b$.
  % 
  The constraint that each row must sum up to~$r$ can then be linearly
  modelled as
  \[
    \forall i \in 1 \twodots v : \sum_{j \in 1 \twodots b} m_{ij} = r
  \]
  % 
  Etc.''

(We are aware that we may lose~1 point if the model described above is
different from what is actually implemented in Task~B and evaluated in
Tasks~C to~H.)

\paragraph{Task~B.}
Our model \texttt{servStatLoc.mod} is uploaded with this report (but
not listed inside it): we checked that its constraints and objective
function are linear (and we are aware that~$4$~points will otherwise
be deducted from our score for this problem).

We chose the MIP solver~\SolverMIP for our experiments, which we ran

The numbers of candidate solutions this brute-force search algorithm
has to examine per second in order to match the reported runtime
performance of~\SolverMIP on our model are given in the right-most
column of Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}, for each instance that~\SolverMIP
solved to proven optimality without timing out.
